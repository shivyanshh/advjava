What is a Thread?
A thread is like a small worker inside your program that can do tasks at the same time as other workers.


magine this:
You’re baking a cake and watching TV at the same time.

🧁 One thread is baking the cake

📺 Another thread is playing the TV

Both are happening at the same time — this is what multithreading means.


In Java:
The main program runs in one thread (called the main thread)

You can create other threads to do different things at the same time

✅ Why use Threads?
To make programs faster or more responsive

To do more than one thing at once, like:

Downloading a file while updating the screen

Playing music while processing user input
